    Evening. My name is <strong>Jahmai Nicholas</strong>, a web developer and web designer.
    I attend <strong>Dominica State College</strong> as a <strong>2nd Semester</strong> IT major.
    I recently changed my major from General Studies to Information Technology.
    I enjoy trading and mentoring people internationally.  
    I work with more international clients than local ones.  
    I am not a full-time mentor yet, but that is my long-term goal.  
    If you would like to talk with me, please message me in the contact section.
