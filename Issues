<section class="content">
  <p> Issue.1 It was very difficult to create the animation smoothly, because i needed a 
modified code to run my exection with the help of <strong>"One Compiler".</p>

  <p> Issue.2 Most of the codes on the class material was outdated so i had to
 remasterd it with the help of Ai for speific options(it could be according to the website).</p>

<p> Issue.3 the hovering animation was quite difficult to process, you must have accurate
calculations for the animation itself.</p>
